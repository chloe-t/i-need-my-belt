# WHAT AM I DOING? 

## Gitlab on prem instance
As my supre mentor asked me to do, I should ask a VM to deploy it. 
Buuuuuut, I am rather interested into using Google Cloud to do since I don't have much occasions to use it.

1 - GCP VM Creation

2 - Git installation 

3 - Docker install

4 - Docker-compose install 



## Single repo? 
Because why not?
